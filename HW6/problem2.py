    Goal of Problem 2: Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) (50 points)
    In this problem, you will implement the AI player based upon Monte-Carlo Tree Search.
    
'''
# ---------------------------------------------------------

'''------------- Class: MCNode (40.0 points) -------
    Now let's implement tree nodes first. Then we can connect the nodes into a search tree.
    This is the class for a Node of a Monte Carlo Search Tree
 
'''
''' ---- Class Properties ----
    * s: the current state of the game, s.b is an integer matrix  (shape: 3 by 3 in TictacToe, 8 by 8 in Othello). 
        s.b[i,j] = 0 denotes that the i-th row and j-th column is empty
        s.b[i,j] = 1 denotes that the i-th row and j-th column is taken by "X". 
        s.b[i,j] = -1 denotes that the i-th row and j-th column is taken by the "O".
        s.x: who's turn in this step of the game (if X player: x=1, or if O player: x=-1)
.
    * p: the parent node of this node.
    * m: the move that it takes from the parent node to reach this node.  m is a tuple (row,column), row:row of move, column:column of the move 
.
    * c: a python list of all the children nodes of this node.
    * v: a float scalar, the sum of game results for all games that used this node during simulation.
    For example, if we have 5 game simulations used this node, and the results of the games are (1,-1,0,1,1),
    the sum of the game results will be 2 = (1 + (-1) + 0 + 1 + 1)
.
    * N: an integer scalar, the number games that used this node for simulation. We can use the these two statistics (v and N) to compute the average pay-offs of each node.
    '''
class MCNode(Node):
    #------------- Method: __init__  ------
    ''' Goal: Create a new node for a Monte Carlo Search Tree    '''
    '''---- Inputs: --------
    * self: a reference to the current instance of the class which is used to access properties of the instance.
    * s: the current state of the game
    * p: the parent node of this node
    * m: the move that it takes from the parent node to reach this node
    '''
    def __init__(self, s, p=None, m=None):
        super(MCNode, self).__init__(s,p=p,m=m,v=0) # initialize v as 0
        self.N=0 # initialize the number of times the node is selected in the simulation as 0
        
        
    #----------------------------------------------------------
    
    #------------- Method: sample  ------
    ''' Goal: Simulation: Use a Monte-Carlo simulation to sample a game result from the current node (self) of the tree. Simulate a game starting from this selected node (self) until the game reaches an end. In the simulation, both players are random players. 
    '''
    '''---- Inputs: --------
    * self: a reference to the current instance of the class which is used to access properties of the instance.
    * g: the game environment being played, such as TicTacToe or Othello
    ---- Outputs: --------
    * e: the result of the game of simulation (X player won:1, tie:0, lose: -1), an integer scalar.
    ---- Example: --------
    In TicTacToe, if the game state in the selected node (n) is:
|-------------------
| Selected Node n
|
|  s.b=[[ 0, 1, 1],
|       [ 0,-1, 1],
|       [-1, 1,-1]]     -- the game state in the node
|  s.x= -1              -- it's "O" player's turn in this step of the game
|    ...
|-------------------
Let's run one random game (where both players are random players, who choose random moves in the game).
# Game Result 1: Suppose in the simulation, the "O" player chooses the move (r=1,c=0), 
then "X" player chooses the move (r=0,c=0), so "X" player wins (e=1). 
# Game Result 2: If the "O" player chooses the move (0,0), then the game ends, "O" player wins (e=-1)
If we run this sample() function multiple times, the function should have equal chance to 
return Result 1 and Result 2. 
 
    ---- Hints: --------
    * You could use RandomPlayer in problem 1 and run_a_game() function in a BoardGame class in game.py to simulate a game starting from the current game state in the node (self). 
    * You could start a game simulation starting with any game state (s) using run_a_game(s=s), by specifying the initial state of the game. 
    * This problem can be solved using only 2 line(s) of code. More lines are okay.'''

    #------------- Method: expand  ------
    ''' Goal: Expand the current tree node by adding one layer of children nodes by adding one child node for each valid next move. Then select one of the children nodes to return.    '''
    '''---- Inputs: --------
    * self: a reference to the current instance of the class which is used to access properties of the instance.
    * g: the game environment being played, such as TicTacToe or Othello
    ---- Outputs: --------
    * c: one of the children nodes of the current node (self). After calling expand(), all the children nodes are equally new, so we could just select any child node for the next step (to run the simulation).
    ---- Example: --------
    In TicTac, if the current node (BEFORE expanding) is like:
|-------------------
|Current Node:   
|  s.b=[[ 0, 1,-1],
|       [ 0,-1, 1],
|       [ 0, 1,-1]]     -- the game state in the node
|  s.x= 1               -- it's "X" player's turn in this step of the game
|    p= None           
|    m= None            
|    c=[] -- no children node
|    v= 0 
|    N= 0 
|-------------------
  There are 3 valid next moves from the current game state.
  AFTER expanding this node, we add three children nodes to the current node.
  The tree looks like this after being expanded:
                      |--> Child Node A
     Current Node --> |--> Child Node B 
                      |--> Child Node C 
  Here are the details of the tree (attributes of each tree node):
 |-------------------
 |Current Node:   
 |  s.b=[[ 0, 1,-1],
 |       [ 0,-1, 1],
 |       [ 0, 1,-1]]     
 |  s.x= 1        -- it's "X" player's turn in this step of the game  
 |    p= None           
 |    m= None            
 |    c=[Child_A, Child_B, Child_C] -- Three children nodes are created and added here
 |    v= 0 
 |    N= 0 
 |-------------------------------
         |Child Node A:   
         |  s.b=[[ 1, 1,-1],
         |       [ 0,-1, 1],
         |       [ 0, 1,-1]]     
         |  s.x=-1            -- it's "O" player's turn in this step of the game 
         |    p= Current_Node -- The parent node of this node is "Current_Node" 
         |    m= (0,0)        -- The move it takes from parent node 
         |                         to this node: first row (0), first column (0) 
         |    c=[] -- this node has not been expanded yet 
         |    v= 0 
         |    N= 0 
         |-----------------------
         |Child Node B:   
         |  s.b=[[ 0, 1,-1],
         |       [ 1,-1, 1],
         |       [ 0, 1,-1]]     
         |  s.x=-1            -- it's "O" player's turn in this step of the game 
         |    p= Current_Node -- The parent node of this node is "Current_Node" 
         |    m= (1,0)        -- The move it takes from parent node 
         |                        to this node: second row (1), first column (0) 
         |    c=[] -- this node has not been expanded yet 
         |    v= 0 
         |    N= 0 
         |-----------------------
         |Child Node C:   
         |  s.b=[[ 0, 1,-1],
         |       [ 0,-1, 1],
         |       [ 1, 1,-1]]     
         |  s.x=-1            -- it's "O" player's turn in this step of the game 
         |    p= Current_Node -- The parent node of this node is "Current_Node" 
         |    m= (2,0)        -- The move it takes from parent node 
         |                        to this node: third row (2), first column (0) 
         |    c=[] -- this node has not been expanded yet 
         |    v= 0 
         |    N= 0 
         |-----------------------
  After the expansion, you need to return one of the children nodes as the output.
  For example, you could return Child Node A, or Child Node B, or Child Node C.
 
    ---- Hints: --------
    * This function is very similar to the expand() in problem 1. 
    * Step 1: get the list of valid next move-state pairs from the current game state.. 
    * You could use g.get_move_state_pairs() function to get all the next moves and next game states from the current game state.. 
    * Step 2: expand the node with one level of children nodes.. 
    *   Step 2.1: for each next move m and game state s, create a new child node.. 
    *   Step 2.2: append the new child node to the child list of the current node.. 
    * This problem can be solved using only 4 line(s) of code. More lines are okay.'''

    ''' Goal: Back propagation: after one simulation in node (S), use the game result to update the statistics in the nodes on the path from node S to the root node. 
Along the way, update v (sum of simulation results) and N (count of simulations). 
    '''
    '''---- Inputs: --------
    * self: a reference to the current instance of the class which is used to access properties of the instance.
    * e: the result of the game of simulation (X player won:1, tie:0, lose: -1), an integer scalar.
    ---- Example: --------
    In TicTacToe, the current game state is
|-------------------
| Root Node:   
|  s.b=[[ 1,-1, 1],
|       [ 0, 0, 0],
|       [ 0, 0,-1]]     -- the game state in the node

Suppose the tree looks like this:

               |--> Child Node A -->|--> Grand Child A1 (v=1,N=1)
               |     1,-1, 1 (v=3)  |--> Grand Child A2 (v=1,N=1)
               |     1, 0, 0 (N=8)  |--> Grand Child A3 (v=0,N=4)
               |     0, 0,-1        |--> Grand Child A4 (v=1,N=1)
               |
               |--> Child Node B -->|--> Grand Child B1 (v=1,N=1)
               |     1,-1, 1 (v=4)  |--> Grand Child B2 (v=1,N=1)
               |     0, 1, 0 (N=9)  |--> Grand Child B3 (v=0,N=5)
               |     0, 0,-1        |--> Grand Child B4 (v=1,N=1)
               |
Root Node ---> |--> Child Node C -->|--> Grand Child C1 (v=0,N=1)
 1,-1, 1 (v=19)|     1,-1, 1 (v=-3) |--> Grand Child C2 (v=0,N=1)
 0, 0, 0 (N=54)|     0, 0, 1 (N=7)  |--> Grand Child C3 (v=0,N=1)
 0, 0,-1       |     0, 0,-1        |--> Grand Child C4 (v=-3,N=3)
               |
               |--> Child Node D -->|--> Grand Child D1 (v=3,N=5)
               |     1,-1, 1 (v=13) |--> Grand Child D2 (v=3,N=5)
               |     0, 0, 0 (N=21) |--> Grand Child D3 (v=4,N=5)(S: selected node)  
               |     1, 0,-1        |--> Grand Child D4 (v=2,N=5)
               |

                     1,-1, 1 (v=1)  |--> Grand Child E2 (v=0,N=1)
                     0, 0, 0 (N=5)  |--> Grand Child E3 (v=1,N=1) 
                     0, 1,-1        |--> Grand Child E4 (v=0,N=1)

Here v is the sum of simulation results, N is the count of game simulations. 
Suppose the selected node for running simulation is "Grand Child D3".
Now we run a simulation starting from D3 node, and get one sample result: X player win (e=1).
The back-propagation is to update the nodes on the path from D3 to Root node.
In each node on the path, the statistics are updated with the game result (e=1)
After back-propagation, the tree looks like this:

               |--> Child Node A -->|--> Grand Child A1 (v=1,N=1)
               |     1,-1, 1 (v=3)  |--> Grand Child A2 (v=1,N=1)
               |     1, 0, 0 (N=8)  |--> Grand Child A3 (v=0,N=4)
               |     0, 0,-1        |--> Grand Child A4 (v=1,N=1)
               |
               |--> Child Node B -->|--> Grand Child B1 (v=1,N=1)
               |     1,-1, 1 (v=4)  |--> Grand Child B2 (v=1,N=1)
               |     0, 1, 0 (N=9)  |--> Grand Child B3 (v=0,N=5)
               |     0, 0,-1        |--> Grand Child B4 (v=1,N=1)
               |

 0, 0, 0 (N=55)|     0, 0, 1 (N=7)  |--> Grand Child C3 (v=0,N=1)
 0, 0,-1       |     0, 0,-1        |--> Grand Child C4 (v=-3,N=3)
               |
               |--> Child Node D -->|--> Grand Child D1 (v=3,N=5)
               |     1,-1, 1 (v=14) |--> Grand Child D2 (v=3,N=5)
               |     0, 0, 0 (N=22) |--> Grand Child D3 (v=5,N=6)(S: selected node)  
               |     1, 0,-1        |--> Grand Child D4 (v=2,N=5)
               |
               |--> Child Node E -->|--> Grand Child E1 (v=0,N=1)
                     1,-1, 1 (v=1)  |--> Grand Child E2 (v=0,N=1)

                     0, 1,-1        |--> Grand Child E4 (v=0,N=1)
 There are three nodes on the path and their statistics are updated as:
 (1) Grand Child D3: v =(4 -> 5),    N =(5 -> 6)
 (2) Child Node D:   v =(13 -> 14),  N =(21 -> 22)

So the Child Node A will have a higher UCB score, and this function will select Child Node A to return.

When there is a tie in the UCB score, use the index of the child node as the tie-breaker.
 
    ---- Hints: --------
    * Step 1: get a list of UCB scores for all children nodes. 
    * Step 2: return the child node with the largest score. 
    * This problem can be solved using only 2 line(s) of code. More lines are okay.'''

    We will call the function l = selection(Root_Node)
    Among the first level of children nodes,  the "Child Node D" has the highest UCB score.
    Then in the second level, we travel down to the "Child Node D" and find that "Grand Child D3" has the highest score
    among all the children nodes of "Child Node D".
    Then we travel down to the "Grand Child D3" and find that this node is a leaf node (no child).
    So we return "Grand Child D3" as the selected node to return.
 
    ---- Hints: --------
    * You could use recursion to solve this problem recursively.. 
    * Step 1: if the root node is a leaf node (no child), return root node. 
    * Step 2: otherwise: select a child node (c) of the root node. 
    * Step 3: recursively select the children nodes of node (c).

    * g: the game environment being played, such as TicTacToe or Othello

    In TicTacToe, suppose the current game state:

          Root Node 
           1,-1, 1 (v=0)
           0, 0, 0 (N=0)
           0, 0,-1 (X player's turn)  

      Now let's run one iteration of Monte-Carlo Tree Search (selection->expand->sample->backprop):
      ---------------------------------
      Iteration 1:  
      ---------------------------------
      (1) selection:  starting from root node, select one leaf node (L)
          In this case, the root node is a leaf node (no child node yet)
      (2) expand: Since the game in the leaf node has not ended yet, we need to expand the node. 
          Then one of the children nodes will be selected, the tree becomes:
                          (O's turn)

                        0, 1,-1        

      (3) Sample: run a Monte-Carlo simulation on the selected Node (S), suppose the result of the game is a draw (e=0)
      (4) Back Prop: Back propagate the simulation result from Node (S) to the root.
          The statistics of the tree look like this:
                       |--> Child Node A (v=0,N=1) (S: Selected Node)

    ---- Hints: --------
    * You could use the functions you implemented above, such as selection(), expand(), sample(),backprop(), to solve this problem.. 
    * Step 1: selection: starting from root node, select one leaf node (L). 
    * Step 2: check if the game in node L has ended, if not ended:. 
    *   Step 2.1: expansion: expand node (L) with one level of children nodes and select one of L's children nodes (C) as the leaf node. 
    *   Step 2.2: simulation: sample a game result from the selected leaf node (C). 
    * Step 3: back propagation: backpropagate the result of the simulation. If the game in node L has already ended, use the game result in L to back propagate. 
    * This problem can be solved using only 6 line(s) of code. More lines are okay.'''

                |     0, 0,-1        |--> Child B4 (v= 1,N=1) -->| ...
  (X's turn)    |
 Root Node ---> |--> Child Node C -->|--> Child C1 (v=-1,N=1) -->| ...
  1,-1, 1 (v=26)|     1,-1, 1 (v=-3) |--> Child C2 (v= 0,N=1) -->| ...

  0, 0,-1       |     0, 0,-1        |--> Child C4 (v=-3,N=3) -->| ...
                |
                |--> Child Node D -->|--> Child D1 (v= 6,N=7) -->| ... 
                |     1,-1, 1 (v=21) |--> Child D2 (v= 5,N=5) -->| ...
                |     0, 0, 0 (N=23) |--> Child D3 (v= 5,N=5) -->| ... 
                |     1, 0,-1        |--> Child D4 (v= 5,N=5) -->| ...
                |
                |--> Child Node E -->|--> Child E1 (v= 0,N=1) -->| ...
                      1,-1, 1 (v=1)  |--> Child E2 (v= 0,N=1) -->| ...
                      0, 0, 0 (N=5)  |--> Child E3 (v= 1,N=1) -->| ... 
                      0, 1,-1        |--> Child E4 (v= 0,N=1) -->| ...     
    The optimal next move will be child node with the largest N (Child Node D) in the first level of the tree. 
    So in this example, the next move should be (r=2, c=0)

 ****************************
 ** Total Points: 95 / 100 ** (this is just an example, you need to run the grading.py to know your grade)
 ****************************

 NOTE: Due to the randomness of the test data and/or initialization of parameters, the results of the same unit test may vary in different runs. If your code could pass a test case with more than 80% probability, you won't lose points in that test case. If you lose points after the grading by the TA due to randomness of the testing, you could contact the TA to show that your code could pass that test case with more than 80% chance, and get the lost points back.

***   How to submit your work?  ***

After running the above grading script, a zip file named "submission.zip" will be created in the same folder of this homework assignment. Please upload this "submission.zip" file in canvas for your final submission. 
NOTE: Please only use the "submission.zip" generated by the grading script as your submision. Don't create a zip file yourself by including all the data files and folder structures in the zip. Because the TA will use an automatic script to grade all the submissions. The script requires all submissions to have a standard format and folder structure. If you create your own zip file, you may be using a different format or name in the submission, which may cause errors in the grading of your submission. Thanks a lot for your contribution to streamlining the grading of homework assignments.

 That's all! Great job! You did it!
