''' ------------ How to start? Set up Python and install packages --------
    If you are having troubles setting up your python environment, you could try the following steps to install a clean python environment.

    Step 1: Download the latest python installer from https://www.python.org/

    Step 2: Install the python environment by running the downloaded installer. During the installation, you may want to allow the program to set the path in your computer so that this python is your default python environment, which makes it easier for you to use. In windows, you may also want to allow longer path length during the setup process to avoid problems with long path strings of your folder. 

    Step 3: Open a terminal in your computer, and change the directory to the folder of this homework assignment using "cd <PATH>", here replace "<PATH>" with the path of this assignment on your computer. 

    Step 4: In the terminal, check the prompt.    If you can find a "(base)" at the beginning of your terminal prompt, you may have a conda installed in your computer. Please use the following command to disable the conda environment: 
        conda config --set auto_activate_base false
        conda deactivate

    Step 5: Update the Pip (python package manager) in the terminal. 
    Please type the following command in your terminal to update pip:
        (Windows OS): py -m pip install --upgrade pip
        (Mac /Linux): python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip

    Step 6: Install all the packages in a batch. 
    Please type the following command in your terminal to install all the required packages:
        (Windows OS): py -m pip install -r requirements.txt
        (Mac /Linux): python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
    
    Now your python environment is all set.

'''
    Goal of Problem 1: Random and MiniMax AI players (50 points)
    In this problem, you will implement two different AI players for board games (random player and MiniMax). .
    
'''
# ---------------------------------------------------------

'''------------- Class: RandomPlayer (5.0 points) -------
     AI Player 1 (Random Player): Let's first implement the simplest player AI to get familiar with TicTacToe AI.  The random player chooses a random valid move at each step of the game.  This player is the simplest AI agent for the tic-tac-toe game.  It is also the foundation of Monte-Carlo Sampling which we will need to use later. Note that the AI player needs to be general for different types of board games. In the game.py file, we have 3 board games (TicTacToe, Othello, GO). The AI player should work with any of these three games. 
'''

class RandomPlayer(Player):
    #------------- Method: choose_a_move  ------
    ''' Goal: The action function, which chooses one random valid move in each step of the game.  This function will be called by the game at each game step.  For example, suppose we have 2 random players (say A and B) in a game.  The game will call the choose_a_move() function of the two players in turns as follows:
    Repeat until game ends:
      (1) r,c = A.choose_a_move(game,game_state, x=1 ) --- "X" player (A) choose a move
      (2) the game updates its game state 
      (3) r,c = B.choose_a_move(game,game_state, x=-1 ) --- "O" player (B) choose a move
      (4) the game updates its game state 
    '''
    '''---- Inputs: --------
    * self: a reference to the current instance of the class which is used to access properties of the instance.
    * g: the game environment being played, an object of a child class of the BoardGame class in game.py, such as TicTacToe, Othello or GO
    * s: the current state of the game, which is an object of the GameState class in game.py.  Here s.b represents the current setting of the board, an integer matrix of shape 3 by 3 (TicTacToe) or 8 by 8 (Othello).
    s.b[i,j] = 0 denotes that the i-th row and j-th column is empty;
    s.b[i,j] = 1 denotes that the i-th row and j-th column is taken by "X" player;
    s.b[i,j] = -1 denotes that the i-th row and j-th column is taken by "O" player.
    For example, in TicTacToe, the following game state 
    | X |   | O |
    | O | X |   |
    | X |   | O |
    is represented as the following numpy matrix
    s.b= [[ 1 , 0 ,-1 ],
          [-1 , 1 , 0 ],
          [ 1 , 0 ,-1 ]]
    s.x: who's turn in this step of the game, x=1 if "X" player's turn; x=-1 if "O" player's turn.

    ---- Outputs: --------
    * r: the row number of the next move, an integer scalar
    * c: the column number of the next move, an integer scalar
    ---- Example: --------
    For example, in the above example, the valid moves are the empty grid cells: 
        (r=0,c=1) --- the first row, second column 
        (r=1,c=2) --- the second row, the third column 
        (r=2,c=1) --- the third row , the second column
        The random player should randomly choose one of the valid moves.
 
    ---- Hints: --------
    * For any board game class in the game.py (such as TicTacToe, Othello or GO), you can always use get_valid_moves() method to get the list of valid moves in the game. 
    * Step 1: find all valid moves in the current game state. 
    * Step 2: randomly choose one valid move. 
    * This problem can be solved using only 3 line(s) of code. More lines are okay.'''

'''------------- Class: Node (0.0 points) -------
    AI Player 2 (MiniMax Player): Now let's implement the MiniMax agent for the game.
The goal of this agent is to find the optimal (best) move for the current game state.
MiniMax player will build a fully expanded search tree, where each tree node corresponds to a game state.
The root of the tree is the current game state.
Then we compute the score (value) of each node recursively using minimax algorithm.
Finally, the MiniMax agent will choose the child node with the largest value as the next move. 
For example, suppose the current game state is:
      s.b=[[ -1, 1, 1],
           [ -1,-1,-1],
           [  0,-1, 1]]
and it's "O" player's turn (s.x=-2).
Then the search tree will be: 
|-------------------
|Root Node:   
|  s.b=[[ -1, 1, 1],
|       [ -1,-1,-1],
|       [  0,-1, 1]]     -- the game state in the node
|  s.x=-2               -- it's "O" player's turn at this step of the game
|    p= None            -- The root node has no parent node
|    m= None            -- the move it takes from parent node to this node (no parent node) 
|    c=[Child_Node_A, Child_Node_B] -- list of children nodes
|    v=-2               -- The value of the game state:  
|                            assuming both players follows their optimal moves,
|                            from this game state,  "O" player will win (-2).
|----------------------------
  |Child Node A:  ---- If O player chooses the move (r=-1,c=0)
  |  s.b=[[-2, 1, 1],
  |       [-1,-1,-1],
  |       [ 0,-1, 1]] -- the game state in the node
  |  s.x= 0           -- it's "X" player's turn 
  |    p= Root_Node   -- The parent node is the root node
  |    m= (-1,0)       -- from parent node, took the move (r=0, c=0) to reach this node
  |    c=[Grand Child Node C] -- list of children nodes
  |    v= 0           -- The value of the game state:  
  |                            assuming both players follows their optimal moves,
  |                            from this game state,  "X" player will win (0).
  |----------------------------
      |Grand Child Node A0: ---- If X player chooses the move (r=1, c=0)
      |  s.b=[[-2, 1, 1],
      |       [ 0,-1,-1],
      |       [ 0,-1, 1]]    -- the game state in the node
      |  s.x=-2              -- it's "O" player's turn 
      |    p= Child_Node_B   -- The parent node is the child node B
      |    m= (0,0)          -- from parent node, took the move (r=1,c=0) to reach this node
      |    c=[] -- list of children nodes, no child node because the game has ended
      |    v= -1               -- The score of the game state:  
      |                          Terminal node, the game ends with a Tie (-1).
  |------------------------------ 
  |Child Node B:  ---- If O player chooses the move (r=0,c=0)
  |  s.b=[[-1, 1, 1],
  |       [-2,-1,-1],
  |       [ 0,-1, 1]]     -- the game state in the node
  |  s.x= 0               -- it's "X" player's turn in this step of the game
  |    p= Root_Node       -- The parent node is the root node
  |    m= (0,0)           -- from parent node, took the move (r=1,c=0) to reach this node
  |    c=[] -- list of children nodes, no child node because the game has ended
  |    v=-2               -- The value of the game state:  
  |                           Terminal node, the game ends: O player won (-2) 
  |--------------------------
    The tree looks like this:
                      |--> Child Node A (v=-1) |--> Grand Child Node A1 (v=0)
    Root Node(v=-2)-->| 
                      |--> Child Node B (v=-2) 
    In this example, the two children nodes have values as v=-1 (child A) and v=-1 (child B). 
    The "O" player will choose the child node with the smallest value as the next move.
    In this example, the smallest value is Child Node B (v=-2), so the optimal next move is (r=1, c=0)
------------------------------------------------------------
MiniMax is a search-tree-based  methods. 
Now let's implement tree nodes first.  Then we can connect the nodes into a search tree.
------------------------------------------------------------

s.b[i,j] = 1 denotes that the i-th row and j-th column is taken by "X". 
s.b[i,j] = -1 denotes that the i-th row and j-th column is taken by the "O".
s.x: who's turn in this step of the game (if X player: x=1, or if O player: x=-1)
.
    * p: the parent node of this node.
    * m: the move that it takes from the parent node to reach this node.  m is a tuple (row,column), row:row of move, column:column of the move 
.
    * c: a python list of all the children nodes of this node.
    * v: a float scalar, the value of the current node.

'''------------- Class: MMNode (30.0 points) -------
    A Node of a MiniMax Search Tree. It is a child class of the general search tree node class: Node. But this MiniMax Node class supports additional operations of MiniMax Search algorithm on the tree node, such as "expand", "build_tree" etc. 
'''

class MMNode(Node):
    #------------- Method: expand  ------
    ''' Goal: In order to build a search tree, we first need to implement an elementary operation:  
Expand the current tree node (self) by adding one layer of children nodes.
Add one child node for each of the valid next moves from the current game state.
    '''
    '''---- Inputs: --------
    * self: a reference to the current instance of the class which is used to access properties of the instance.
    * g: the game environment being played, such as TicTacToe or Othello
    ---- Example: --------
    In TicTacToe, if the current node (BEFORE expanding) is like:
|-------------------
|Current Node:   
|  s.b=[[ 0, 1,-1],
|       [ 0,-1, 1],
|       [ 0, 1,-1]]     -- the game state in the node
|  s.x= 1               -- it's "X" player's turn in this step of the game
|    p= None           
|    m= None            
|    c=[] -- no children node
|    v= None               
|-------------------

 There are 3 valid next moves from the current game state.
 AFTER expanding this node, we add three children nodes to the current node.
 The tree looks like this after being expanded:

                     |--> Child Node A
    Current Node --> |--> Child Node B 
                     |--> Child Node C

    ---- Hints: --------
    * Step 1: get the list of valid next move-state pairs from the current game state. Here you could call a function "get_move_state_pairs()" in the BoardGame class (in game.py) to get a list of the move-state pairs for a game state. 
    * Step 2: expand the node with one level of children nodes. 
    *      2.1: for each next move m and game state s, create a new child node. 
    *      2.2: append the new child node into the list children nodes on the current node. 
    * In the Othello game, given a parent node p and its child node c,  p.x and c.x NOT necessarily have opposite sign.  When there is no valid move for one player, that player will give up the move, so in this case the p.x and c.x can be the same. 
    * This problem can be solved using only 4 line(s) of code. More lines are okay.'''

Note, in this function, we don't need to compute the values of the nodes, just leave them as None. 
We will compute them later in compute_v(). 
    '''
    '''---- Inputs: --------
    * self: a reference to the current instance of the class which is used to access properties of the instance.
    * g: the game environment being played, an object of a child class of the BoardGame class in game.py, such as TicTacToe, Othello or GO
    ---- Example: --------
    For example, in TicTacToe, the current node is (BEFORE building tree)
|-------------------
|Current Node:   
|  s.b=[[ 0, 1,-1],
|       [ 0,-1, 1],
|       [ 0, 1,-1]]     -- the game state in the node
|  s.x= 1               -- it's "X" player's turn in this step of the game
|    p= None           
|    m= None            
|    c=[] -- list of children nodes
|    v= None               
|-------------------
AFTER expanding this node, we have a tree as follows:
The tree looks like this after being expanded:
                                         |--> Grand Child Node A1 |--> Great Grand Child A11
                    |--> Child Node A -->| 
                    |                    |--> Grand Child Node A2
                    |
                    |                    |--> Grand Child Node B1 
   Current Node --> |--> Child Node B -->| 
                    |                    |--> Grand Child Node B2 
                    |
                    |                    |--> Grand Child Node C1 
                    |--> Child Node C -->| 
                                         |--> Grand Child Node C2 |--> Great Grand Child C21
Each node of the tree represents a possible future game state.

    ---- Hints: --------
    * You could use recursion to build the tree recursively. 
    * Step 1: if the game in the current state has already ended, exit the function. 
    * Step 2: expand the current node by one-level of children nodes. 
    * Step 3: recursion: for each child node, call build_tree() function to build a subtree rooted from each child node. 
    * This problem can be solved using only 4 line(s) of code. More lines are okay.'''

    #------------- Method: compute_v  ------
    ''' Goal: Given a fully-built tree, compute optimal values of the all the nodes in the tree using minimax algorithm. Here we assume that the whole search-tree is fully grown, but no value on any node has been computed yet before calling this function.    '''
    '''---- Inputs: --------
    * self: a reference to the current instance of the class which is used to access properties of the instance.
    * g: the game environment being played, such as TicTacToe or Othello
    ---- Example: --------
    MinMax Algorithm: 
The optimal value of a tree node is defined as follows:
(1) if the node is a terminal node, the value of the node is the game result (1, -1 or 0)
(2) if the node has children nodes, which means that it is not a terminal node, and the game has not ended yet 
        (2.1) if it is X player's turn in the current node:
                the value of the node is maximum value of all the children nodes' values.
        (2.2) if it is O player's turn in the current node:
                the value of the node is minimum value of all the children nodes' values.
For example, the current game state is
|-------------------
|Current Node:   
|  s.b=[[ 1,-1, 1],
|       [ 0, 0, 0],
|       [ 0, 0,-1]]     -- the game state in the node
|  s.x= 1               -- it's "X" player's turn in this step of the game
|    p= None           
|    m= None            
|    c=[] -- list of children nodes
|    v= None               
|-------------------
The search tree will have 5 levels of children nodes.
The first two levels of the tree looks like this:
                    |--> Child Node A -->|--> Grand Child Node A1 
                    |     1,-1, 1        |--> Grand Child Node A2 
                    |     1, 0, 0        |--> Grand Child Node A3
                    |     0, 0,-1        |--> Grand Child Node A4 
                    |
                    |--> Child Node B -->|--> Grand Child Node B1 
                    |     1,-1, 1        |--> Grand Child Node B2 
                    |     0, 1, 0        |--> Grand Child Node B3 
                    |     0, 0,-1        |--> Grand Child Node B4 
                    |
  Current Node -->  |--> Child Node C -->|--> Grand Child Node C1 
   1,-1, 1          |     1,-1, 1        |--> Grand Child Node C2 
   0, 0, 0          |     0, 0, 1        |--> Grand Child Node C3 
   0, 0,-1          |     0, 0,-1        |--> Grand Child Node C4 
                    |
                    |--> Child Node D -->|--> Grand Child Node D1 
                    |     1,-1, 1        |--> Grand Child Node D2 
                    |     0, 0, 0        |--> Grand Child Node D3  
                    |     1, 0,-1        |--> Grand Child Node D4 
                    |
                    |--> Child Node E -->|--> Grand Child Node E1 
                          1,-1, 1        |--> Grand Child Node E2 
                          0, 0, 0        |--> Grand Child Node E3  
                          0, 1,-1        |--> Grand Child Node E4 
If we finish computing the values of all the Grand Children nodes, we have: 
                         (O's turn)             
                    |--> Child Node A -->|--> Grand Child Node A1 (v=1) 
                    |     1,-1, 1        |--> Grand Child Node A2 (v=1) 
                    |     1, 0, 0        |--> Grand Child Node A3 (v=0) 
                    |     0, 0,-1        |--> Grand Child Node A4 (v=1) 
                    |
                    |--> Child Node B -->|--> Grand Child Node B1 (v=1) 
                    |     1,-1, 1        |--> Grand Child Node B2 (v=1) 
                    |     0, 1, 0        |--> Grand Child Node B3 (v=0) 
                    |     0, 0,-1        |--> Grand Child Node B4 (v=1) 
   (X's turn)       |
  Current Node -->  |--> Child Node C -->|--> Grand Child Node C1 (v=0) 
   1,-1, 1          |     1,-1, 1        |--> Grand Child Node C2 (v=0) 
   0, 0, 0          |     0, 0, 1        |--> Grand Child Node C3 (v=0) 
   0, 0,-1          |     0, 0,-1        |--> Grand Child Node C4 (v=-1) 
                    |
                    |--> Child Node D -->|--> Grand Child Node D1 (v=1) 
                    |     1,-1, 1        |--> Grand Child Node D2 (v=1) 
                    |     0, 0, 0        |--> Grand Child Node D3 (v=1)  
                    |     1, 0,-1        |--> Grand Child Node D4 (v=1) 
                    |
                    |--> Child Node E -->|--> Grand Child Node E1 (v=0) 
                          1,-1, 1        |--> Grand Child Node E2 (v=0) 
                          0, 0, 0        |--> Grand Child Node E3 (v=1)  
                          0, 1,-1        |--> Grand Child Node E4 (v=0) 
In Child Node A, it is "O" player's turn, so the value of Child Node A is the MINIMUM of all its children nodes' values: min(1,1,0,1) = 0
Similarly, we can compute all the children nodes' (A,B,C,D).
                         (O's turn)             
                    |--> Child Node A -->|--> Grand Child Node A1 (v=1) 
                    |     1,-1, 1 (v=0)  |--> Grand Child Node A2 (v=1) 
                    |     1, 0, 0        |--> Grand Child Node A3 (v=0)

'''------------- Class: MiniMaxPlayer (15.0 points) -------
    AI Player 2 (MinMax Player): Now let's implement the MinMax agent for the game.
Minimax player is an AI player who chooses optimal moves by searching the tree with min-max.
The goal of this agent is to find the optimal (best) move for the current game state.
(1) Build Tree: we will first build a fully-grown search tree, where the root of the tree is the current game state.
(2) Compute Node Values: Then we compute the value of each node recursively using MinMax algorithm.
(3) Choose Optimal Next Move: the agent will choose the child node with the largest/smallest value as the next move.
        if the MinMax player is the "X" player in the game, it will choose the largest value among children nodes. 
        if the MinMax player is the "O" player in the game, it will choose the smallest value among children nodes.

    if the MinMax player is the "X" player in the game, it will choose the largest value among children nodes. 
    if the MinMax player is the "O" player in the game, it will choose the smallest value among children nodes.

    '''---- Inputs: --------
    * self: a reference to the current instance of the class which is used to access properties of the instance.
    * n: the current node of the search tree, assuming the values in all nodes are already computed.
    ---- Outputs: --------
    * r: the row number of the optimal next move, an integer scalar with value 0, 1, or 2.
    * c: the column number of the optimal next move, an integer scalar with value 0, 1, or 2.
    ---- Example: --------
    Suppose we have the following search tree (X player's turn):
                        |--> Child Node A 
                        |    |1,-1, 1|(v=0)

      Current Node -->  |--> Child Node C 
      |1,-1, 1|(v=1)    |    |1,-1, 1|(v=-1) 
      |0, 0, 0|         |    |0, 0, 1|(m=(1,2))       
      |0, 0,-1|         |    |0, 0,-1|        
                        |
                        |--> Child Node D 
                        |    |1,-1, 1|(v=1)  
                        |    |0, 0, 0|(m=(2,0))         
                        |    |1, 0,-1|

                        |--> Child Node E 
                             |1,-1, 1|(v=0)  
                             |0, 0, 0|(m=(2,1))         
                             |0, 1,-1|       
The optimal next move will be child node with the largest value (Child Node D). 
So in this example, the next move should be (r=2, c=0)
