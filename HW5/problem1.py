    NOTE: For better readability of the instructions, 
          please turn on the 'Word Wrap' setting in your editor. 
    HOW: For example, in the VS Code editor, click "Settings" in the menu, 
         then type "word wrap" in the search box of the settings, 
    choose "on" in the drop-down menu.
    TEST: If you can read this long sentence without scrolling your screen from left to right, it means that your editor's word wrap setting is on and you are good to go.

''' ------------ How to start? Set up Python and install packages --------
    If you are having troubles setting up your python environment, you could try the following steps to install a clean python environment.

    Step 1: Download the latest python installer from https://www.python.org/

    Step 2: Install the python environment by running the downloaded installer. During the installation, you may want to allow the program to set the path in your computer so that this python is your default python environment, which makes it easier for you to use. In windows, you may also want to allow longer path length during the setup process to avoid problems with long path strings of your folder. 

    Step 3: Open a terminal in your computer, and change the directory to the folder of this homework assignment using "cd <PATH>", here replace "<PATH>" with the path of this assignment on your computer. 

    Step 4: In the terminal, check the prompt.    If you can find a "(base)" at the beginning of your terminal prompt, you may have a conda installed in your computer. Please use the following command to disable the conda environment: 
        conda config --set auto_activate_base false
        conda deactivate

    Step 5: Update the Pip (python package manager) in the terminal. 
    Please type the following command in your terminal to update pip:
        (Windows OS): py -m pip install --upgrade pip
        (Mac /Linux): python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip

    Step 6: Install all the packages in a batch. 
    Please type the following command in your terminal to install all the required packages:
        (Windows OS): py -m pip install -r requirements.txt
        (Mac /Linux): python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
    
    Now your python environment is all set. 
     ------------------------------------------------'''


''' ------------Test Your Python Environment --------------
    After installing python and packages in your computer, you may want to test if your python environment meets the requirements. If your python version is incorrect or you didn't install a required package successfully, you may not be able to solve this homework assignment correctly.

def Terms_and_Conditions():
    ''' 
      By submitting this homework or changing this function, you agree with the following terms:
       (1) Not sharing your code/solution with any student before and after the homework due. For example, sending your code segment to another student, putting your solution online or lending your laptop (if your laptop contains your solution or your Dropbox automatically copied your solution from your desktop computer to your laptop) to another student to work on this homework will violate this term.
       (2) Not using anyone's code in this homework and building your own solution. For example, using some code segments from another student or online resources due to any reason (like too busy recently) will violate this term. Changing other's code as your solution (such as changing the variable names) will also violate this term.
       (3) When discussing with any other students about this homework, only discuss high-level ideas or use pseudo-code. Don't discuss about the solution at the code level. For example, two students discuss about the solution of a function (which needs 5 lines of code to solve) and they then work on the solution "independently", however the code of the two solutions are exactly the same, or only with minor differences (variable names are different). In this case, the two students violate this term.
      All violations of (1),(2) or (3) will be handled in accordance with the WPI Academic Honesty Policy.  For more details, please visit: https://www.wpi.edu/about/policies/academic-integrity/dishonesty
      Note: We may use the Stanford Moss system to check your code for code similarity. https://theory.stanford.edu/~aiken/moss/
      Historical Data: In one year, we ended up finding 25% of the students in that class violating one of the above terms and we handled ALL of these violations according to the WPI Academic Honesty Policy.

    * You could use np.exp(x) to compute the exponential of x. 
    * When computing exp(z), you need to be careful about an overflowing case. When the z is a large number (say 1000),  the computer can no longer store the result in a floating-point number. In this case, we may want to avoid computing exp(z) and assign the final result of L(x) directly. When z is very large (say 1000), 1+exp(z) will be very close to exp(z), so we can simplify the equation "log(1+exp(z))-yz" into   "log (exp(z)) - yz".

* dL_dw: (Type: np.ndarray),  the partial gradient of the loss function L w.r.t. the weight vector w, a numpy float vector of length p.  The i-th element represents ( d_L / d_w[i]). 
* dL_db: (Type: float),  the partial gradient of the loss function L w.r.t. the bias b, a float scalar. 
* alpha: (Type: float),  the step-size parameter of gradient descent, a float scalar. 
* n_epoch: (Type: int),  the number of passes to go through the training dataset in the training process, an integer scalar. 
* n: (Type: int),  the number of data instance in the training set. 
* n_test: (Type: int),  the number of data instance in the test set. 
* X: (Type: np.ndarray),  the feature matrix of training instances, a float numpy matrix of shape (n by p). 
* Y: (Type: np.ndarray),  the labels of training instance, a numpy integer vector of length n. The values can be 0 or 1. 
* Ytest: (Type: np.ndarray),  the predicted labels of test data samples, an integer numpy array of length ntest. Ytest[i] represents the predicted label on the i-th test sample. 
* P: (Type: np.ndarray),  the predicted probabilities of test data samples to have positive labels, a float numpy vector of length n_test.  P[i] is a value is between 0 and 1, indicating the probability of the i-th data sample to have positive label.
