    Goal of Problem 2: Logistic Regression (with PyTorch) (20 points)
    In this problem, you will re-implement the logistic regression method using PyTorch. Implementing logistic regression in PyTorch is much easier than in NumPy, because we now have many high-level functions/tools to use in PyTorch, which are specially designed for neural networks. In the model.py file, we have already build the network structure of a logistic regression model in PyTorch, now we need to figure out how to train the model parameters using data. We will get familiar with how to compute the loss on a mini-batch of training samples, and use back-propagation to compute the gradients 
.
    A list of all variables being used in this problem is provided at the end of this file.

''' ---------Function: compute_z (5 points)--------------------
    Goal: (Forward Function 1) Given a logistic regression model (m) defined as in 'model.py', please compute the linear logits z on a mini-batch of data samples x =[x1, x2, ... x_batch_size]. In the mean time, please also connect the global gradient of the linear logits z (dL_dz) with the global gradients of the weights dL_dw and the biases dL_db in the PyTorch tensors. 
    ---- Inputs: --------
    * x: (Type: th.Tensor), the feature vectors of a mini-batch of data samples, a float torch tensor of shape (batch_size, p), each row x[i] is the feature vector of the i-th data sample in the mini-batch.
    * m: (Type: th.nn.Module), a logistic regression model (a PyTorch nn.Module), which is defined in "model.py" (LogisticRegression class), it includes the weights and bias in the linear layer.
    ---- Outputs: --------
    * z: (Type: th.Tensor), the linear logits on a mini-batch of data samples, a float torch tensor of shape (batch_size, 1), each row z[i,0] is the linear logit of the i-th data sample in the mini-batch.
    ---- Hints: --------
    * This problem can be solved using 1 line(s) of code. More lines are okay. '''

''' ---------Function: compute_L (5 points)--------------------
    Goal: (Forward Function 2) Suppose we are given a logistic regression model and we have already computed the linear logits z on a mini-batch of training samples. Suppose the labels of the training samples are in y. Please compute the average cross-entropy loss of the logistic regression model on the mini-batch of training samples. In the mean time, please also connect the global gradients of the linear logits z (dL_dz) with the loss L correctly. 
    ---- Inputs: --------
    * z: (Type: th.Tensor), the linear logits on a mini-batch of data samples, a float torch tensor of shape (batch_size, 1), each row z[i,0] is the linear logit of the i-th data sample in the mini-batch.
    * y: (Type: th.Tensor), the labels of a mini-batch of data samples, a torch integer vector of length batch_size. y[i,0] is the label of the i-th training sample, which can be 0 or 1.
    ---- Outputs: --------
    * L: (Type: th.Tensor), the average binary cross entropy loss on a mini-batch of training samples, a torch float scalar.
    ---- Hints: --------
    * We need to use BINARY cross entropy loss instead of regular cross-entropy loss, because regular cross-entropy loss is designed for multi-class classification problem. But in our problem, we only have binary categories: owner vs non-owner. 
    * In order to avoid numerical issues, we need to find a function in PyTorch that combines the sigmoid function and negative log likelihood function together for binary classification. So the input is linear logit (z) instead of activation (a). 
    * The loss L is a scalar, computed from the average of the cross entropy losses on all samples in the mini-batch. For example, if the cross entropy losses on the 3 training samples are 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, then the average loss L is (0.1+0.2+0.3)/3 = 0.2. 
    * This problem can be solved using 1 line(s) of code. More lines are okay. '''

''' ---------Function: update_parameters (5 points)--------------------
    Goal: (Gradient Descent) Suppose we are given a logistic regression model with parameters (w and b) and we have a mini-batch of training data samples (x,y).  Suppose we have already computed the global gradients of the average loss L w.r.t. the weights w on the mini-batch of data samples. Assume that we have already created an optimizer for the parameter w and b. Please update the weights w and bias b using gradient descent. After the update, the global gradients of w and b should be set to all zeros. 
    ---- Inputs: --------
    * optimizer: (Type: th.optim.Optimizer), a PyTorch optimizer (such as SGD, ADAM, RMSProp) to handle the gradient descent for parameters in the model (weights and bias).
    ---- Hints: --------
    * Although the parameters w and b are NOT given explicitly in the input of this function, but we can assume the w and b are already properly configured in the optimizer. So the optimizer is configured to handle the parameters w and b. 
    * Although the gradients of the parameters dL_dw and dL_db are NOT given explicitly in the input of this function, but we can assume that in the PyTorch tensors w and b, the gradients are already properly computed and are stored in W.grad (for dL_dw) and b.grad (for dL_db). 
    * Although the learning rate is NOT given explicitly in the input of this function, but we can assume that the optimizer was already configured with the learning rate parameter. 
    * This problem can be solved using 2 line(s) of code. More lines are okay. '''

We repeat n_epoch passes over all the training samples.

'''---------- Static Type Checking (optional) ---------
Before running unit tests for this problem file, please consider using the static typing checker to check your code above. Using static typing can help catch type-related issues, which can save time and prevent bugs from reaching runtime. Static type checking examines function signatures and variable types to ensure they align as intended, reducing the likelihood of encountering unexpected type errors.
Please type the following command in your terminal to check types in this problem file:
        (Windows OS): py -m mypy --check-untyped-defs problem2.py
        (Mac /Linux): python3 -m mypy --check-untyped-defs problem2.py
Note: Type-checking is optional. It's only used for debuging. The errors in the type checking are NOT considered in the grading. So you coud ignore the type-checking errors. Only errors in the unit tests (in grading.py) are considered in the grading.
