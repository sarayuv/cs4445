    Goal of Problem 4: Ranking webpages using PageRank (AKA random walk with restart using matrix G) (48 points)
    In this problem, you will implement the ranking algorithm for webpages using PageRank (random walk with restart on the revised hyperlink graph to solve both sink node and sink region problems). 
 ------------------------------------ 
      Search Engine (Version 3) 
 ------------------------------------ 
 In this version of the search engine, we implement use random walk method on a revised hyperlink graph to address both sink node and sink region problem. (1) If a webpage has no hyperlink (which is a sink node), add a hyperlink from this webpage to all the webpages in the network (including itself); (2) for every step of the random walk, the user will have a small probability to jump to a random webpage ignoring the hyperlinks and a large probability to follow the hyperlink.
    A list of all variables being used in this problem is provided at the end of this file.

''' ---------Function: count_out_links (5 points)--------------------
    Goal: Given an adjacency matrix A of a webpage hyperlink network, compute the count of out-links (also called 'degree') for each webpage in the network. 
    ---- Inputs: --------
    * A: (Type: np.ndarray), the adjacency matrix indicating the hyperlinks between webpages, a numpy matrix of shape (n X n). A[i,j] =1, if there is a hyperlink from webpage j to webpage i; A[i][j]=0, if there is no hyperlink from webpage j to webpage i.

''' ---------Function: remove_sink_nodes (5 points)--------------------
    Goal: Given an adjacency matrix A (containing sink nodes), find all sink nodes in the network, then revise the adjacency matrix A by adding a hyperlink from each sink node to all the webpages (including itself) 
	 For example, if the adjacency matrix of 5 webpages are as follows: 
	   0,0,0,1,0 
	   1,0,0,0,0 
	   0,1,0,1,0 
	   0,1,0,0,0 
	   0,0,0,1,0 
	 In this adjacency matrix, the 3rd and 5th columns are both all-zero columns, which means that the 3rd and 5th webpages are sink nodes in the graph. 
	 In order to remove sink nodes, we want to add all-ones to these columns, so that the new adjacency matrix will be: 
	   0,0,1,1,1 
	   1,0,1,0,1 
	   0,1,1,1,1 
	   0,1,1,0,1 
	   0,0,1,1,1 
	 So this should be the output adjacency matrix A of this function .

    ---- Example: --------
    For example, suppose we have two vectors x=[1.05, 4.03], y=[1.02, 4.05], if the tolerance is 0.1, then x and y are 'close'. In this case, the returned result (c) should be True 
    For example, suppose we have two vectors m=[1.05, 4.03, 0.16], n=[1.02, 4.05, 0.35], if the tolerance is 0.1, then m and n are NOT 'close', because the last element is not close to each other within the tolerance. In this case, the returned result (c) should be False
