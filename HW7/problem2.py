    Goal of Problem 2: Transformer Model (50 points)
    In this problem, you will implement a few key components of the transformer model. Instead of using multi-head attention, in this problem, we focus on building single-head attention layer.
    
'''
# ---------------------------------------------------------

'''------------- Class: QK_DotProduct (5.0 points) -------
    (QK dot product) One of the most important design of the transformer model is the attention module for understanding the words in sentences. The attention model is based upon the QKV (Query, Key, Value) design: we first compute the pair-wise dot product of the Queries and Keys for all word pairs, and then sale the dot products, so that we can find the similarities/relations/connections between different word pairs, then in the next question, we will be able to use the pairwise similarities computed here to propagate the values between words. The similarities between words are computed by first compute the dot products between the query vectors and key vectors (as the raw scale) and then scaling these dot products to compute the similarity scores. So in this function, let's build a neural network layer that can compute the dot products (before scaling) between the queries and keys of all the words : Give the query vectors and key vectors of a set of words, compute the pairwise dot products between queries and keys of the word pairs using dot product.

Please type the following command in your terminal to compute your score of this HW assignment:
        (Windows OS): py grading.py
        (Mac /Linux): python3 grading.py
 The grading.py will run all the unit tests of this HW assignment and compute the scores you get. 
 For example, if your code for this HW can get 95 points, you will see this message at the end in the terminal
 ****************************
 ** Total Points: 95 / 100 ** (this is just an example, you need to run the grading.py to know your grade)
 ****************************

 NOTE: Due to the randomness of the test data and/or initialization of parameters, the results of the same unit test may vary in different runs. If your code could pass a test case with more than 80% probability, you won't lose points in that test case. If you lose points after the grading by the TA due to randomness of the testing, you could contact the TA to show that your code could pass that test case with more than 80% chance, and get the lost points back.

***   How to submit your work?  ***

After running the above grading script, a zip file named "submission.zip" will be created in the same folder of this homework assignment. Please upload this "submission.zip" file in canvas for your final submission. 
NOTE: Please only use the "submission.zip" generated by the grading script as your submision. Don't create a zip file yourself by including all the data files and folder structures in the zip. Because the TA will use an automatic script to grade all the submissions. The script requires all submissions to have a standard format and folder structure. If you create your own zip file, you may be using a different format or name in the submission, which may cause errors in the grading of your submission. Thanks a lot for your contribution to streamlining the grading of homework assignments.

 That's all! Great job! You did it!
