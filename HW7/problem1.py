    NOTE: For better readability of the instructions, 
          please turn on the 'Word Wrap' setting in your editor. 
    HOW: For example, in the VS Code editor, click "Settings" in the menu, 
         then type "word wrap" in the search box of the settings, 
    choose "on" in the drop-down menu.
    TEST: If you can read this long sentence without scrolling your screen from left to right, it means that your editor's word wrap setting is on and you are good to go.

''' ------------ How to start? Set up Python and install packages --------
    If you are having troubles setting up your python environment, you could try the following steps to install a clean python environment.

    Step 1: Download the latest python installer from https://www.python.org/

    Step 2: Install the python environment by running the downloaded installer. During the installation, you may want to allow the program to set the path in your computer so that this python is your default python environment, which makes it easier for you to use. In windows, you may also want to allow longer path length during the setup process to avoid problems with long path strings of your folder. 

    Step 3: Open a terminal in your computer, and change the directory to the folder of this homework assignment using "cd <PATH>", here replace "<PATH>" with the path of this assignment on your computer. 

    Step 4: In the terminal, check the prompt.    If you can find a "(base)" at the beginning of your terminal prompt, you may have a conda installed in your computer. Please use the following command to disable the conda environment: 
        conda config --set auto_activate_base false
        conda deactivate

    Step 5: Update the Pip (python package manager) in the terminal. 
    Please type the following command in your terminal to update pip:
        (Windows OS): py -m pip install --upgrade pip
        (Mac /Linux): python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip

    Step 6: Install all the packages in a batch. 
    Please type the following command in your terminal to install all the required packages:
        (Windows OS): py -m pip install -r requirements.txt
        (Mac /Linux): python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
    
    Now your python environment is all set.

def Terms_and_Conditions():
    ''' 
      By submitting this homework or changing this function, you agree with the following terms:
       (1) Not sharing your code/solution with any student before and after the homework due. For example, sending your code segment to another student, putting your solution online or lending your laptop (if your laptop contains your solution or your Dropbox automatically copied your solution from your desktop computer to your laptop) to another student to work on this homework will violate this term.
       (2) Not using anyone's code in this homework and building your own solution. For example, using some code segments from another student or online resources due to any reason (like too busy recently) will violate this term. Changing other's code as your solution (such as changing the variable names) will also violate this term.
       (3) When discussing with any other students about this homework, only discuss high-level ideas or use pseudo-code. Don't discuss about the solution at the code level. For example, two students discuss about the solution of a function (which needs 5 lines of code to solve) and they then work on the solution "independently", however the code of the two solutions are exactly the same, or only with minor differences (variable names are different). In this case, the two students violate this term.
      All violations of (1),(2) or (3) will be handled in accordance with the WPI Academic Honesty Policy.  For more details, please visit: https://www.wpi.edu/about/policies/academic-integrity/dishonesty
      Note: We may use the Stanford Moss system to check your code for code similarity. https://theory.stanford.edu/~aiken/moss/
      Historical Data: In one year, we ended up finding 25% of the students in that class violating one of the above terms and we handled ALL of these violations according to the WPI Academic Honesty Policy.

    Goal of Problem 1: Recurrent Neural Network for Binary Time Sequence Classification (50 points)
    In this problem, you will implement the recurrent neural network for binary sequence classification problems.  Here we assume that each time sequence is assigned with one binary label.  For example, in audio classification, each time sequence is a short clip of audio recording, and the label of the sequence is either 0 (non-wake word) or 1 (wake word).  The goal of this problem is to learn the details of recurrent neural network by building RNN from scratch.  The structure of the RNN includes one recurrent layer repeating itself for l time steps and a fully-connected layer attached to the last time step of the recurrent layer to predict the label of a time sequence.  (Recurrent layer for time step 1)-> (Recurrent layer for time step 2) -> ...(Recurrent layer for time step t) -> (Fully connected layer) -> predicted label..
